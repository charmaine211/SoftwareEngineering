## Tests
The tests in this directory are written for PyTest.

Please run tests from the root of this project to include the proper dependencies (like `pytest.ini`).

For example:
```bash
> pytest -v
```

### Continuous Integration

All tests are used in CI-pipelines. All tests should pass before merging to the main-branch.
