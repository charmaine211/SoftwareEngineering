# Working with the assignments. A guide.

During the Software Engineering course, you will be working with a prototype
application written in Python. This application can sign files (e.g., documents)
that are uploaded via a web interface. Moreover, it can be used to verify a
signature given a file and a signature. An application like this can be used
in the public sector to obtain a signature from a certain institution if a
particular document submitted by a citizen is valid. Afterwards, a citizen can
use the signature on the document to fulfill a particular administrative process.

This application is based on the MVC Django framework and contains an example
REST API that you will need to extend. The application has been tested in 
both Linux (Ubuntu 20), MacOS 12 and Windows 10, using python 3.8 and python 3.9.
In this document, we describe how to set up the environment with all the required
tools for this application:

    - Git: You will receive the application via yOUlearn.
        Afterwards, you will need to set up your own git project (it
        can be private) in GitLab where you will invite the members of your
        team and the teacher. You will work through git to make changes in the 
        application and to present your work.
    - SCRUM: You will follow the SCRUM methodology during the duration of the 
        project with your team. You have to register at iceScrum, a web platform
        for small teams (3 members) so that you can plan your sprints and choose the tasks.
    - A code editor. There are many in Linux (emacs, vi, sublime etc.), MacOS and Windows.
        A practical and free one is Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
    - A console emulator. Most of the work in these assignments require using the terminal. 
        If you are using Windows, you might enjoy cmder (https://cmder.net/).
