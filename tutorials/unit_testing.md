## Passing the implemented unit tests

The ecdsa/ directory contains a description of a new class that will
be used in the next version of the application. You will need to work
with it during the assignments. Some unit tests have been implemented
using the pytest framework. You can run the implemented tests with:

```
cd authority/ou/ecdsa; pytest
```
